          Hello! I'm Camila Villalobos, a passionate UX/UI designer and web developer based in Orlando, Florida.
          With a strong foundation in digital media and a love for creating clean, user-centered designs,
          I specialize in building websites and applications that are both beautiful and functional.
          My background in graphic design and front-end development allows me to bridge the gap between creativity and technology,
          bringing ideas to life through thoughtful design solutions.
          I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Arts in Digital Media at the University of Central Florida,
          and Iâ€™m dedicated to growing my skills every day. Thank you for visiting my portfolio!
